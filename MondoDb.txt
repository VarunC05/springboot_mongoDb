MongoDB

	- MongoDb is a non-sequential database where there is no fixed schema.
	- it comes with the similar structure like database-collection-document-fields.
	- it stores the value in bson(binary represntation of json) format.
	- each row/field is its own id.
	- The basic difference between mongo and mongodb is mongo is the provides commands for storing data into mongodb.
	- mongodb V6.0 does not support cmd as it was deprecated, instead it provides its own shell called mongosh. Mongosh is to be downloaded explicitly.
